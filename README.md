# Customer Cancellation Data Analysis with Dashboard
Data science and analytics project to reduce customer cancellations.

Challenge:

A company with over 800,000 customers recently realized that most of its total customer base is inactive, meaning that it has already canceled its service.

In order to improve its results, it wants to understand the main reasons for these cancellations and the most efficient actions to reduce this number.

To solve the company's problem, I performed an exploratory and visual analysis to obtain several insights through predictive analysis. I also created an AI model to predict future cancellations and help the company make the most accurate decisions.

For this work, I used Python and the main libraries for data analysis and science, with VS Code and Jupyter Notebook.

I also developed a Dashboard for this project using the Streamlit library.
To test the Predict New Data page of the Dashboard, download the file novos_cancelamentos.csv that is in the Dashboard Folder.

Software and equipment used for development: Python 3.12.8 - Libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)

Operating System: Windows 11 Home Single Language.

Computer: HP 256 G9 - Intel Core I3.
